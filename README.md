# Streamlining Employee Data

Wouldn't it be great if our data was stored in our favorite format, ready to be analyzed? Unfortunately, that's rarely the case. Data comes in different formats, and being able to merge these various sources in a single file for analysis is a fundamental skill for any data practitioner.

This project is available through [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), where I completed it to consolidate my knowledge after finishing the [Data Analyst with Python Career Track] (https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-analyst-with-python). With access to some employee and human resources data, my task as an analyst was to shape it and save it in a way, so that the Department could easily understand and use it. 

The datasets in this project are small, consisting of only a few rows of sample data. Regardless, the focus here is not on the size of the dataset(s), but on employing various data analysis skills using **pandas**. These include: **importing data from multiple sources across multiple file types**, **merging and manipulating the data** before finally **cleaning** it, and **exporting** it into a single CSV file.
